# DC_GAN

# This repository consists of my implementation of the Deep Convoluted Generative Adversial Network on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Done using PyTorch

The datasets can be found at http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

A paper implementation can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434 by Alec Radford, Luke Metz, Soumith Chintala. 

# A sample batch of images
